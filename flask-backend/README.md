# Python Devcontainer Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for developing Python Flask applications using VS Code Devcontainers.

- `.devcontainers.json` uses the `Dockerfile` in the root directory to create the container and configures VS Code with all the necessary extensions to develop in Python.

- `Dockerfile` installs all the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` file that is needed by the application.

## To start the application run:

```bash
python main.py 
```
